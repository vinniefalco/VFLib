/**
    Temporary audio buffers for intermediate calculations.

    This container provides a pool of audio buffers that grow to match the
    working set requirements based on actual usage. Since the buffers never
    shrink or get deleted, there are almost no calls to the system to allocate
    or free memory.

    This is ideal for AudioIODeviceCallback implementations which process
    audio buffers and require temporary storage for intermediate calculations.
    The usage style is to request a temporary buffer of the desired size,
    perform calculations, and then release the buffer when finished.

    Buffers are intelligently resized and recycled to consume the smallest
    amount of memory possible based on the usage pattern, with no effort
    required by the programmer.

    To use the container, create an instance of the AudioBufferPoolType
    template, and specify the type of lock to use for synchronization. By
    default, a CriticalSection is used but if you aren't sharing the pool
    between threads, you can use a DummyCriticalSection instead.

    Here's an example:

    @code

    AudioBufferPoolType <DummyCriticalSection> pool;

    // Request a stereo buffer with room for 1024 samples.
    AudioBufferPool::Buffer* buffer = pool.requestBuffer (2, 1024);

    // (Process buffer)

    // Release the buffer to be re-used later.
    pool.releaseBuffer (buffer);

    @endcode

    Since Buffer is derived from AudioSampleBuffer, it can be used anywhere
    an AudioSampleBuffer is expected. This example requests a temporary buffer
    and stores it in an AudioSourceChannelInfo:

    @code

    // Request a stereo buffer with room for 1024 samples.
    AudioBufferPool::Buffer* buffer = pool.requestBuffer (2, 1024);

    // Fill out the AudioSourceChannelInfo structure with the buffer
    AudioSourceChannelInfo info;
    info.buffer = buffer;         // allowed, since AudioBufferPool::Buffer *
                                  // is-a AudioSampleBuffer *
    info.startSample = 0;
    info.numSamples = 1024;

    // Clear out the range of samples
    info.clearActiveBufferRegion ();

    @endcode
